    )

{-| The auto-generated code from the `@dillonkearns/elm-graphql` CLI will provide `selection`
functions for Objects, Interfaces, and Unions in your GraphQL schema.
These functions build up a `Graphql.SelectionSet` which describes a set
of fields to retrieve. The `SelectionSet` is built up in a pipeline similar to how
[`Json.Decode.Pipeline`](http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/NoRedInk/elm-decode-pipeline/latest)
builds up decoders.

For example, if you had a top-level query `human(id: ID!)` which returns an object
of type `Human`, you could build the following GraphQL query document:

    query {
      human(id: 1001) {
        name
        id
      }
    }

In this example, the `SelectionSet` on `human` is:

    {
      name
      id
    }

You could build up the above `SelectionSet` with the following `dillonkearns/elm-graphql` code:

    import Api.Object
    import Api.Object.Human as Human
    import Graphql.SelectionSet as SelectionSet exposing (SelectionSet, with)

    type alias Human =
        { name : String
        , id : String
        }

    hero : SelectionSet Hero Api.Interface.Human
    hero =
        SelectionSet.succeed Human
            |> with Human.name
            |> with Human.id

Note that all of the modules under `Api.` in this case are generated by running
the `@dillonkearns/elm-graphql` command line tool.

The query itself is also a `SelectionSet` so it is built up similarly.
See [this live code demo](https://rebrand.ly/graphqelm) for an example.

## Combining

## Types

These types are built for you by the code generated by the `@dillonkearns/elm-graphql` command line tool.

## Result (`...OrFail`) Transformations

**Warning** When you use these functions, you lose the guarantee that the
server response will decode successfully.

These helpers, though convenient, will cause your entire decoder to fail if
it ever maps to an `Err` instead of an `Ok` `Result`.

{-| Maps the data coming back from the GraphQL endpoint. In this example,
`User.name` is a function that the `@dillonkearns/elm-graphql` CLI tool created which tells us
that the `name` field on a `User` object is a String according to your GraphQL
schema.

    import Api.Object
    import Api.Object.User as User
    import Graphql.SelectionSet exposing (SelectionSet, with)

    human : SelectionSet String Api.Object.User
    human =
        User.name |> SelectionSet.map String.toUpper

You can also map to values of a different type (`String -> Int`, for example), see
[`examples/StarWars.elm`](https://github.com/dillonkearns/elm-graphql/blob/master/examples/src/Starwars.elm) for more advanced example.

{-| Include a `SelectionSet` within a `SelectionSet`. This is the equivalent of
including a [GraphQL fragment](https://graphql.org/learn/queries/#fragments) in
plain GraphQL queries. This is a handy tool for modularizing your GraphQL queries.

([You can try the below query for yourself by pasting the query into the Github query explorer](https://developer.github.com/v4/explorer/)).

Let's say we want to query Github's GraphQL API like this:

    {
      repository(owner: "dillonkearns", name: "elm-graphql") {
        nameWithOwner
        ...timestamps
        stargazers(first: 0) { totalCount }
      }
    }

    fragment timestamps on Repository {
      createdAt
      updatedAt
    }

We could do the equivalent of the `timestamps` fragment with the `timestampsFragment`
we define below.

    import Github.Object
    import Github.Object.Repository as Repository
    import Github.Object.StargazerConnection
    import Graphql.Operation exposing (RootQuery)
    import Graphql.OptionalArgument exposing (OptionalArgument(..))
    import Graphql.SelectionSet as SelectionSet exposing (SelectionSet, with)
    import Iso8601
    import Time exposing (Posix)

    type alias Repo =
        { nameWithOwner : String
        , timestamps : Timestamps
        , stargazersCount : Int
        }

    type alias Timestamps =
        { createdAt : Posix
        , updatedAt : Posix
        }

    repositorySelection : SelectionSet Repo Github.Object.Repository
    repositorySelection =
        SelectionSet.succeed Repo
            |> with Repository.nameWithOwner
            |> withFragment timestampsFragment
            |> with stargazersCount

    timestampsFragment : SelectionSet Timestamps Github.Object.Repository
    timestampsFragment =
        SelectionSet.succeed Timestamps
            |> with (Repository.createdAt |> mapToDateTime)
            |> with (Repository.updatedAt |> mapToDateTime)

    mapToDateTime : Field Github.Scalar.DateTime typeLock -> Field Posix typeLock
    mapToDateTime =
        Field.mapOrFail
            (\(Github.Scalar.DateTime value) ->
                Iso8601.toTime value
                    |> Result.mapError (\_ -> "Failed to parse " ++ value ++ " as Iso8601 DateTime.")
            )

    stargazersCount : Field Int Github.Object.Repository
    stargazersCount =
        Repository.stargazers
            (\optionals -> { optionals | first = Present 0 })
            (fieldSelection Github.Object.StargazerConnection.totalCount)

Notice that we are using two different techniques for abstraction here.
We use `|> withFragment timestampsFragment` to include a fragment and we use
`|> with stargazersCount`. What's the difference? For the `timestampsFragment`,
we want to pull in some fields at the same level of the `SelectionSet` we are
building up. But for the `stargazersCount`, we are simply extracting a `Field`
which builds up a nested `SelectionSet` that grabs the `totalCount` within the
`stargazers` `Field`.

            selectionDecoder2
        )


{-| Include a hardcoded value.

        (Decode.map2 (|>)
            (Decode.succeed constant)
            objectDecoder
        )


{-| Instead of hardcoding a field like `hardcoded`, `SelectionSet.succeed` hardcodes
an entire `SelectionSet`. This can be useful if you want hardcoded data based on
only the type when using a polymorphic type (Interface or Union).

    type alias Character =
        { details : Maybe HumanOrDroid
        , name : String
        }

    type HumanOrDroid
        = Human
        | Droid

        SelectionSet.succeed Character

Often GraphQL schemas will contain things like `[String]` (i.e. a nullable list
of nullable strings) when they really mean `[String!]!` (a non-nullable list of
non-nullable strings). You can chain together these nullable helpers if for some
reason you can't go in and fix this in the schema, for example:
